# Basic-Express-Server

## Project: Basic Express Server

## Author: Zoe Gonzalez

### Problem Domain: This application exists for the purpose of practicing deployment of server more in depth than I did in 301. This also expands by adding an additional path way by adding a test for a query and name. It functions very similarily to the server.js test and it is very concise.
